8.my future: the good parts.
Life would look absolutly great, I feel like all my life I have taken two steps foward and five steps back. I know with Umuzi by my side pushing me to be the best version of myself all things will be possible. I would be able to help my family , build a better life for myself and my loved ones.In the future I do want to have many businesses and property that I own, renting it out as well as being finantially free.
