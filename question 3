3.What do I do in my free time?
I have just been up skilling in coding, I do play video games and I drum sometimes cause that has been a passion of mine from young, I go for walks with my girlfriend, help out around the house and really enjoy eating haha. I love to braai and chill with family and friends. Life is good when you have positive people around you. So yes going for walks on the beach, watching ,movies, up skilling in coding, helping out around the house, washing my dads car so he will let me take it for a drive.
