6.What might get in the way of my success?
I might be a emotional person and find it hard to take critics sometimes, but I will make sure to push those feelings aside when it comes to the proffessionasl world. Sometimes not everything is meant to be taken to heart, I am trying to teach myself that everyday. I must focus on the positives and the good in life, appretiate what I have and keep moving foward. No matter how hard things get I must keep moving foward. I know how to overcome my weaknesses but sometimes it just gets to me, I still need help understanding JavaScript but I will try my hardest.
