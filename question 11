11.The importance of doing my own work.
It just does not make any sense to copy others work because when it is time for your skills to be tested you will fail for sure, there will not be anyway you can copy something when your skills are being put to the test.
It is a great idea because only then you will truly grasp and understand the concept of your work, it will be great for you because when you are put into a job then you will succeed. You will feel better about yourself as well knowing you worked hard to get where you are.
