2.Why do I want this career?

Since a child I always felt like I had a calling to do something on computers I just could not figure it out fully, only since last year though i finally figured it out and hit the nail on the head, it is coding. I have never felt more drawn too something and never tried so hard to figure something out than I am now, it is a feeling i've never felt before. To be so passionate about learning something. I am truly grateful that I finally feel this way about something, it took a long time to figure out what I want to do with my life but i finally feel like I have something great im pushing myself towards.
