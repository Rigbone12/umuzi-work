7.My routine.
I like to get up at about 7:30am and start my day from there, do a quick exercise in the morning to get my blood flowing. From there have a shower then eat and start my work for the day. I would take a break around 12pm and continue for the rest of the day. Finishing whatever work that needs to be done around 6pm. I am an early bird.
