5.What makes me think I'll succeed as a coder?
Although life has not been the best I have never ever given up, I have always tried to push myself the hardest I can in all positions I have been in, in life. The key is to understand, ask questions and never ever give up, a person who succeeds in life is just someone who never gave up, no matter how you feel always give it 100% of you and God will make a way for you if it is meant to be.
