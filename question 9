9. my future: the scary parts.
This is something I try not to think about too much, there is a always a possibility things do not work out and I have felt that first hand, but I am tired of not having any direction in life and not moving anywhere, I try to stay positive and optimistic always, it is hard at times but if I am being honest I would most likely go back into plumbing. I do not want to though haha.
